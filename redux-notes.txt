Three Core Concepts
1. Shop         ->  Store    ->  Holds the state of our application
2. Cake Ordered ->  Action   ->  Describes what happened
3. ShopKeeper   ->  Reducer  ->  Ties the store and actions together

A `store` that holds the state of our application
An `action` that describes what happened in the application.
A `reducer` which handles the action and decides how to update the state.
